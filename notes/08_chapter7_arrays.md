# Chapter 7: Arrays

...

## Trace Program with Arrays

```cpp
int main() {
    int values[5];
    for (int i=1; i<5; i++) {
        //...
    }
}
```

## Printing Arrays

To print an array, you have to print each element in the ...

```cpp
//
```

## Copying Arrays

Need to copy element by element

```cpp
// Under the condition that new array is the same size or larger than original array
for (int = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
    list[i] = myList[i];
}
```

## Random Shuffling

```cpp
/*
The range of these numbers is 0 to ARRAY_SIZE-1
Randomly shuffle values to different indexes
*/
```

## Passing Arrays to Functions

You should aslo pass its **size** in another argument, so that the function knows how many elements are in the array. The array in the function is the same as ...

```cpp

```

## Preventing Changes of Array Arguments in Functions

```cpp

```

## Returning Arrays from Functions
