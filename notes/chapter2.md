## Notes

### Programming style and documentation

* use comments

### Programming errors

* Syntax (Compile Errors): errors that are detected by the compiler. Mistyping a keyword, omitting necessary punctuation, etc.
* Runtime errors: Cause a program to terminate abnormally. Wront type of input, division by zero
* Logic errors: Occur when program does not perform the way it was intended

### Identifiers

* A name used to identify a variable, function, class, object, or other user-defined entity in the program.
...

### Variables

* In C++, variables must be declared with a specific data type ex:
``int count``, ``double radius = 11.2``
* C++ allows an alternative syntax for declaring and initializing variables ``...``

#### Common variable types

* ...
* ...
* ...
* ...
* ...

### Operator Precedence

* Integer / Integer = Integer
* Float / Integer = Float
* Double / Integer = Float

### Numeric Type Conversion

* Yes - can assign an integer value to a floating point variable
* Yes - can assign a floating-point value to an integer variable

```cpp
int i = 34.7  // i becomes 34
double f
...

```

### Console Input (cin) Function

>>
...

### Reading input from keyboard

...

### Character data type

...

### Special Characters and Casting

ASCII code:

#### Escape Sequences

...

### Comparing and Testing

...

### The string Type

* Include `<string>` header

```cpp
string message = "Programming is fun"
```

* ...
* The functions in the string class ...
* `message[0]` and `message.at(0)` are the same thing

### Reading Strings

## Git commands

1. `git status`
2. `git add <filename>` (now file is in staging area)
3. `git commit -m "put commit message here`
4. `git push`
